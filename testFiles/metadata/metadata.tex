\section{Basic Usage}
Currently the metadata content flags a license, acknowledgement, and allows for some abstract tagging. 
Currently the tag command is not in use and will be depreciated for some kind of xmtag command when we want to reinstate tagging.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
This should have an acknowledgement for Bart, Jason, and Wim. And should be flagged as having the license "fakeLicense2.0".
This should only be shown in the metadata section of the website source material.

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
