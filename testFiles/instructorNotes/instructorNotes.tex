\section{Basic Usage}
The instructor notes enivronment is intended to have specific behavior in the pdf, and that behavior depends on if it is a handout pdf or not.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}

Currently the below just shows an environment with a box around it with the content in it. 
Presumably this will be stylized differently at some point?

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
\begin{instructorIntro}
This is an instructor Intro.
\end{instructorIntro}


\begin{instructorNotes}
This is an instructor note.
\end{instructorNotes}
