\section{Basic Usage}
The title, maketitle, and author commands should work as expected in normal LaTeX, with added functionality for the online version.

\textbf{Note:} For information on the table of contents and stylizing/formating that part, see the ToC test/demo.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
The title of this is ``Title Base Usage'', the author is ``Jason'', 
and we have included an abstract with ``Test/Demo of basic title command usage''
(all set with the traditional commands/environments).
Using these, the \verb|\maketitle| populates the online activity tile with the title and abstract, and the author is available in the metadata
as well as listed in the pdf (unless a noauthors flag is used).
