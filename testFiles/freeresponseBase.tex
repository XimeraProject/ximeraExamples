\section{Basic Usage}
The freeResponse environment is used to record a block of text input from students. 
Currently there is no automatic grading or assessment mechanism for this environment.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
Below should have an html embedded text input box with the prompt ``Input some stuff here.''

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
\begin{freeResponse}
    Input some stuff here.
\end{freeResponse}
