\title{This is an activity without the maketitle Command}

%\input{preamble.tex}% Only add a preamble file if it is actually necessary for the demo/test.
\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
    The same as ``activity.tex'' but no maketitle command
\end{abstract}
%\maketitle

{{\Huge \bfseries Last Updated: \today}} \\


\section{Basic Usage}
This is a copy of activity.tex with maketitle commented out. 
It is used to demonstrate what it looks like without including a \verb|\maketitle| command.\\

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
This should show (both at the xourse level, and in the navigation panel) a box without the normal title (but it does show an abstract).
Note that this tile does have a title (via the same \verb|\title| command), just no \verb|\maketitle| to implement it.

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
Look at the xourse level and/or navigation panel.
