\section{Intended Outcome of Test}

The intended outcome section should show what the output of the demo case looks like, without actually using the DemoCom itself.
Any inconsistencies in formating/display should be noted as well as possible here as well, but it is important to not use the 
DemoCom itself so that we have an objective ``anticipated output'' to use as a comparison to what is \textit{actually} output in
test. 

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}

This should contain the actual test/demonstration of DemoCom, which can then be compared to the description above to look for 
unexpected behavior.
