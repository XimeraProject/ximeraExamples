\section{Intended Useage}
    This should include any use cases that need testing that aren't captured in the other sections below.
    Since the sections below (should) only be \LaTeX{} commands/environments (ideally not ximera-specific
    commands/environments), most of the actual test environments of interest will likely be in this section.

    \subsection{Intended Outcome of Test}


    \subsection{Start of Test/Demo Area}

%%%%%
%%  We may want to split the below off as some kind of other test file for each thing?
%%  Like a "LaTeX Core Interaction Test" type file for each, rather than having it in
%%  the "intended use" test which is for the actual ximera stuff?
%%%%%

\section{\LaTeX{} environment interaction testing.}
    This should contain the testing element inside various common \LaTeX{} environments.
    Note, we don't need the intended subsection part as these are standard environments,
    so the intended outcome should be intuitive and clear.

    \subsection{center env test}
        \begin{center}
            (This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.)
        \end{center}

    \subsection{align env test}
        \begin{align}
            \text{(This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.)}
        \end{align}

    \subsection{math mode env test}
        In-line Mathmode Test:\\
            $\text{(This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.)}$\\
        Display Math Mode Test:\\
        \[
            \text{(This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.)}
        \]

    \subsection{enumerate and itemize tests}
        Enumerate Test:\\
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.
        \end{enumerate}
        Itemize Test:\\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.
        \end{itemize}

\section{\LaTeX{} command interaction testing.}
    This should contain the testing element interactions with common \LaTeX{} commands.
    Note, we don't need the intended subsection part as these are standard commands,
    so the intended outcome should be intuitive and clear.

    \subsection{Styling Commands}
        Bolding via \verb|\textbf|:\\
        \textbf{This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.}\\
        Bolding via \verb|\bfseries|:\\
        {\bfseries This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.}\\

        italics via \verb|\textit|:\\
        \textbf{This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.}\\
        italics via \verb|\itshape|:\\
        {\itshape This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.}\\

        emphasis via \verb|\emph|:\\
        \emph{This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.}\\

        Footnote formatting:\\
        \footnote{This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.}

    \subsection{Verbatem Tests}
        Using the verb command:\\
        \verb|This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.|\\
        Using the verb environment:\\
        \begin{verbatim}
        This Test Does Not Apply to this Element.
        \end{verbatim}
