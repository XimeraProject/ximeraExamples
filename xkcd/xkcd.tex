  Inlclude XKCD.

\maketitle

If you open an xkcd link, e.g. https://xkcd.com/899/, you will see a note at the bottom with the link. For this one, number\_line is in the link for the image. Use the \verb!\xkcd{}! command, note that you need to use \verb!\detokenize{_}! so underscores are interpreted appropriately. E.g. \verb!\xkcd{number\detokenize{_}line}!:

\begin{image}
\xkcd{number\detokenize{_}line}
\end{image}

Also note that this does not work in the PDF.
