\section{Basic Usage}
This is a dummy activity intended to be loaded as a practice tile and used to verify that the basic formatting works.\\

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
You shouldn't see any kind of description or title, just the default practice tile format (traditionally a thin vertical line in the navigation panel
and at the xourse level.)

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
Look at the xourse level and/or navigation panel.
