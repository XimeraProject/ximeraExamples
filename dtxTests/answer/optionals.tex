\section{Basic Usage}
The \verb|\answer[#1]{#2}| command has the following optional keyword-value arguments: tolerance, validator, id, format, given.

Each of these should be used in the form ``key=value'' and separated by a comma.

\textbf{Note:} Any special symbol or otherwise unparseable content in argument of answer will result in any submitted answer 
(including a blank answer) being marked correct.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
Below should be several answer boxes, which have the optional arguments (in order) of: tolerance=0.1, id=problemX, format=string, given=true.

The provided answers are (in order) $5$, $x$, $\text{problem answer}$, $3x^2 - 4$

The first answer should accept any decimal from $4.9$ to $5.1$, 
the second should save the provided response result as ``problemX'' (testable through console),
the third should only take ``problem answer'' as the correct answer (case and order sensitive), 
[\textbf{Note:} if format=string is not working, then it will take any permutation of those letters as correct],
the fourth answer will be displayed in the pdf (i.e. given=true says to print the answer in the answer box, rather than a question mark).


\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
\begin{problem}

$\answer[tolerance=0.1]{5}$

$\answer[id=problemX]{x}$

$\answer[format=string]{problem answer}$

$\answer[given=true]{3x^2-4}$

\end{problem}
