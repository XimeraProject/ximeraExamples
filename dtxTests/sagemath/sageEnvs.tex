\section{Basic Usage}
The sagesilent environment is for writing sage code that is processed externally (at a sage server) 
so that it can be called later in the document via commands like \verb|\sage|

\textbf{NOTE:} This is currently not functional, as the default server currently does not run sage in this deployment iteration.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
Below should be \verb|x = 5| where the ``5'' is generated via sage.


\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
\begin{sagesilent}
ex = 5
\end{sagesilent}
$x = \sage{ex}$
