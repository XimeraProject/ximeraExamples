If you have come to this tile, then the test you checked only contains default hard-coded content
and has no commands or environments to test - i.e. there is nothing for a content author or end-user to interact with that
could have been changed to have unexpected behavior. 

An example of this would be the banner.dtx file that just defines a default banner/picture, or suppress.dtx which
contains an internal-only command that should not be used by content authors or end users.
