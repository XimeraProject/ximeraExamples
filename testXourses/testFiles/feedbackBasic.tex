\section{Basic Usage}
Feedback is an environment that can be put inside a problem environment that also contains some kind of student interactive that can be marked as
correct or incorrect (e.g. an \verb|\answer| command, or a multipleChoice type environment).\\

Feedback currently takes one of two optional parameters, either `correct' or `attempt' and then displays the content of the feedback environment
once the answer has been marked correct, or flagged as attempted respectively.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}

Below should be a problem that asks ``what is $2 + 2$'' with an answer box. 
Upon submitting any attempt (correct or incorrect) it should say ``valiant effort'' in the feedback.
Upon a correct submition it should say ``You are correct!'' in the feedback.

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
\begin{problem}
    What is $2+2$? $\answer{4}$
    \begin{feedback}
        valiant effort
    \end{feedback}
    \begin{feedback}[correct]
        You are correct!
    \end{feedback}
\end{problem}
