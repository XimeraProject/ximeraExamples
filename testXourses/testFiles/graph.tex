\section{Basic Usage}
The \verb|\graph| command takes in a function, and provides a graph of that function online.

\textbf{Note:} You do not need to be in mathemode, or use mathemode in the argument of the \verb|\graph| command. 
Putting mathemode in the argument (e.g. \verb|\graph{$3x$}|) will make an error. 

\textbf{Note:} The actual online graphing aspect of this seems to be currently no longer working on the local server.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
Below should be the graph of $x^2 - 3x + 2$.

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
\graph{x^2 - 3x + 2}
