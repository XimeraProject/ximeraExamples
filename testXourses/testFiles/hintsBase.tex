\section{Basic Usage}
The hints environment is an environment that hides the content in an expandable box that cannot be expanded for
the first 10 seconds of the page load - to be used inside a problem environment to provide hints.

If you want to have multiple hints, you should have one after the other, \textbf{not} nest them.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}

Below should be a problem that says ``What is the answer'' with a ``hint'' button above and to the right of the text (inside the problem)
that, when clicked, will show the countdown until it can be opened. Once opened, it should say ``The answer is 4.''.

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}

\begin{problem}
    \begin{hint}
        The answer is 4.
    \end{hint}
    What is the answer? $\answer{4}$.
\end{problem}
