\section{Basic Usage}
The command \verb|\textcolor{#1}{#2}| allows one to apply text color (argument \#1) to the provided text (argument \#2), both in the pdf and online. 
This only works with colors that are defined in the underlying LaTeX. This should also work with colors defined in LaTeX via \verb|\definecolor| from
the xcolor package. 

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
Below should be the words ``Look at these colors'' where ``Look'' is in aquamarine (defined using RGB values), 
and ``colors'' is in dark red (defined using hexadecimal).

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
\textcolor{xmlightblue}{Look} at these \textcolor{darkred}{colors}
