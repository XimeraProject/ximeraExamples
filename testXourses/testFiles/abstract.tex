\section{Basic Usage}

The abstract is an environment that is currently required and placed after the \verb|\begin{document}| command 
(which is not usually the case in LaTeX, which can lead to some confusion).

The content of the abstract should be only text, and the text should appear at the top of the page,
as well as on the tile (unless it is a practice tile) for the page, after the title.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}

For this page you should see the text:
\begin{quote}
    This is the abstract text inside the abstract environment.
\end{quote}

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
N/A (Abstract text is always located at the top of the page, currently below the horizontal navigation bar).

\hrulefill
