\section{Basic Usage}
The sageCell environment should create an interactive text box that is running sage, allowing for students to input sage code and have it run.

\textbf{NOTE:} This is currently not functional, as our server currently does not run sage in this deployment iteration.
It is also unclear if the public sage server will support sageCell implementation.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
Below should be an interactive text box that is running sage.

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
\begin{sageCell}
Some sage code.
\end{sageCell}
