\section{Basic Usage}
Footnotes\footnote{Footnotes should appear at the bottom} are available via the standard \verb|\footnote| command.


Footnotes\footnote{Footnotes should appear at the bottom} are available via the standard \verb|\footnote| command.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
Below is the statement: ``This is a statement that has a footnote''. There should be a footnote after ``statement'' and another after ``footnote''.
Online, clicking the footnote symbol itself should expand an inline parenthetical with the footnote contents. On the pdf, it should be 
a standard footnote.

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
This is a statement\footnote{more of a phrase really?} that has a footnote.\footnote{I guess it would be some footnotes since there are two.}
