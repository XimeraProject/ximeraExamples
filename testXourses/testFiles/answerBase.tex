\section{Basic Usage}
The \verb|\answer{#1}| command should take the intended-correct answer as its argument, and should be just an empty box online, 
that will take any (mathematically equivalent) answer that matches the provided answer.

\textbf{Note:} Any special symbol or otherwise unparseable content in argument of answer will result in any submitted answer 
(including a blank answer) being marked correct.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
Below should be an answer box that should mark anything equivalent to ``$4x + 1$'' as correct (and reject anything else). 

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}

\begin{problem}

    $\answer{4x + 1}$

\end{problem}
