\section{Basic Usage}
The proof environment is a standard typesetting to denote a proof of a theorem. This should be pretty self explanatory.

\textbf{NOTE:} Currently this isn't actually implemented in the html, but should be working in the pdf.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
You should see a block labeled as a proof. In the proof should be;
``This is the proof of some theorem. It should be as a proof.''

\section{Start of Test/Demo Area}
\begin{proof}
    This is the proof of some theorem. It should be as a proof.
\end{proof}
