\section{Basic Usage}
Problem environments are intended to contain any problems that students need to interact with to get credit.
There are currently four instantiated versions of a problem-style environment. They are problem, question, exploration, and exercise.
They are functionally indentical to Ximera, but are supplied with different names for pedagogical reasons.

\section{Intended Outcome of Test}
Below should be one of each problem with an answer box in each with correct answer of $4$ 
to test the basic creation, evaluation, and styling of problem-like environments. 
Each correct answer should provide approximately one quarter of the total page credit.
